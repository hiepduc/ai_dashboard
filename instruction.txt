To put client of ai-dashboard on netlify

(0) First et the ai-dashboard code
git clone git@bitbucket.org:oehcas/ai_dashboard.git
ln -s /mnt/scratch_lustre/duch/ai_dashboard ai_dashboard
cd ai_dashboard
cd client

(1) Install the nodejs with conda in nodeenv environment
source ~/.bashrc.conda
conda create -n nodeenv nodejs -y
conda activate nodeenv
node -v
npm -v

(2) Build the client using node package manager (npm)
(a)npm install
(b) npm run build
The project was built using Vite, a fast frontend build tool.

Output files were generated in the build/ directory.

(3) After build, install the client on netlify by first installing netlify command line interface netlify-cli
(a) npm install -g netlify-cli
(b) netlify --version
(c) netlify login
This will open a browser window where you authorize Netlify. Once you grant access, your Linux shell will be ready to deploy.

(d) netlify deploy --dir=build

The CLI will ask:

? Create & configure a new site? (Y/n)
If you already have a Netlify site and want to attach to it, answer “n” and pick from the list.

If you want to make a brand-new site, answer “Y” and follow the prompts to give it a name (or let Netlify choose one).

Next it will ask:

? Team:   <select your team>
? Site Name (optional): <enter or leave blank>
? Deploy path: build/

It will then upload the contents of build/ and give you a draft URL (something like https://splendorous-yeot-5b6f09.netlify.app/).

If everything is ok, then promote to production

(e) netlify deploy --dir=build --prod

You now have ai-dashboard client on netlify

(4) Whenever you rebuild locally (npm run build), just re-run:

netlify deploy --dir=build --prod

and Netlify will update your live site.

That’s it—your Vite-built dashboard is now live and production-ready on Netlify.
