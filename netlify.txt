Netlify is a hosted service that makes it very easy to deploy static websites and single-page applications. In practice, you:

Connect your code repo (GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket) or use the CLI to deploy directly.

Netlify automatically builds your site (using whatever build command youâ€™ve specified, e.g., npm run build).

It then publishes the built files (HTML, CSS, JS, assets) to a global CDN, giving you a live URL (like https://my-site.netlify.app).

You can optionally attach a custom domain (e.g., dashboard.example.com) and get free HTTPS.

Netlify handles continuous redeploys (whenever you push new code) and offers features like form handling, serverless functions, and split testing for JavaScript-based web apps.
